## Purpose
To document my journey as I learn more about Machine Learning while also providing an intuitive way to visualize how a neural network optimizes until convergence

## How to run
Simply clone the repository and run 'main.py'. Make sure 'LinearRegressionModel.py' is in the same directory. The project was built and tested on Python 3.10.0
